### Requirements:
- **VMware PowerCLI**: All scripts require VMware PowerCLI for interacting with VMware vSphere.
  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -Force


VMware Horizon PowerShell Module: For VMware VDI provisioning, the Horizon PowerShell module is required.
powershell
Copy code
Install-Module -Name VMware.Horizon.Powershell -Force
Setup Instructions
1. Configure vCenter Credentials:
In each script that interacts with your vCenter server, you need to replace the following placeholders with your actual vCenter credentials:

$vcServer: The hostname or IP address of your vCenter server.
$vcUsername: The username used to authenticate with vCenter (e.g., administrator@vsphere.local).
$vcPassword: The password associated with the username.
Example configuration in the script:

powershell
Copy code
$vcServer = "vcenter.example.com"
$vcUsername = "administrator@vsphere.local"
$vcPassword = "password"
2. Configure Email/SMS Notifications:
Some scripts, such as VMware_vSphere_Event_Monitoring_System.ps1 and VMware_Log_Aggregator_And_Analyzer.ps1, are designed to send email or SMS notifications when critical events or issues are detected. To configure these notifications:

Email Notifications: You need to set the following parameters in the script:

$emailRecipient: The email address to which alerts will be sent.
$smtpServer: The SMTP server used to send the email alerts.
$fromEmail: The sender's email address.
Example configuration for email:

powershell
Copy code
$emailRecipient = "admin@example.com"
$smtpServer = "smtp.example.com"
$fromEmail = "vmware-alerts@example.com"
SMS Notifications: If you want to send SMS notifications, you can integrate with an SMS gateway provider (e.g., Twilio). The process involves replacing the email-sending logic with the SMS API provided by your gateway.

Example:

powershell
Copy code
# Integrate with Twilio or other SMS provider to send SMS alerts
For both email and SMS notifications, ensure that the credentials, server settings, and API keys are correctly set according to your organization's configuration.

3. Running the Scripts:
After configuring your credentials and notifications, you can run each script by following these steps:

Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script:
powershell
Copy code
.\VMware_<script_name>.ps1
4. Automating Script Execution:
You can schedule these scripts to run automatically at specified intervals using Task Scheduler or another automation tool. This is especially useful for scripts that monitor or maintain VMware environments regularly.

Conclusion:
This repository contains a variety of automation scripts designed to simplify VMware management tasks. These tools allow for efficient handling of VMware infrastructure, from monitoring and patching to VM lifecycle management and health checks. By automating these processes, administrators can save time, reduce manual effort, and maintain the health of their VMware environments.
